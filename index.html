        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p><strong>Lancashire Police: Jan 2017 - Present</strong></p>
        <p>At Lancashire Police I am a Police Control Room Operator. Part of my job is to take 999 Emergency calls and during those calls I summarise 
          initially what the emergency is to pass through to dispatch who will deploy a Police Officer.
          The other part of my role is as a dispatcher and this is when my colleagues take emergency calls through to me and I would deploy the most nearest
          and suitable patrol to deal with the emergency. 
          In both roles, as a call taker and dispatcher, I continously assess the threat, risk and vulnerability so that I can decide what incidents warrant an 
          emergency response and which incidents can wait.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Lancashire County Council: Jan 2008 - Jan 2017</strong></p>
        <p>At Lancashire County Council I worked as a 'multi-skilled customer services officer'. My role was to be the first point of contact for the residents
          of Lancashire calling in to either report a pothole on the Highway, or perhaps they were looking to apply for a Disabled Blue Badge, request a permit
          to get rid of waste using a vehicle bigger than a car, or perhaps to apply for a School place for their children I would help those callers to the best
          of my ability. 
          In addition to helping people on the phone I would also reply to emails we received of a similar nature. Occasionally I would also see people face-to-face when
          they arrive at the office.
        </p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>Working at Lancashire Police has allowed me to hone my skills in working under extreme pressures. Such incidents could be dealing with a murder
          and when I have patrols committed to such an incidents there are still emergencies coming in for other areas that require deployment of a Police Officer
          to protect the victim(s) and/or the public. I enjoy the pressure cooker of the control room, I thrive in the pressure and I love the fast-paced nature
          of the control room.</p> 

        <p>Currently, I am going through the process of learning how to write in HTML, CSS, Javascript and other computer programming languages. I am fitting this in
          around my career at the Police, my family life and my training regime. I am a keen cyclist and I constantly compete against myself to become better, faster
          and stronger. Such work ethics has allowed me to lose weight from 114kg to 86kg.
